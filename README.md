# Kill Team 2021 Calculator ("ktcalc")
Calculator for helping analyze shooting and fighting attacks in Kill Team (2024 edition and formerly 2021 edition). Heavily inspired by kt2.doit-cms.ru (now offline).

Live at [jmegner.github.io/KT21Calculator](https://jmegner.github.io/KT21Calculator/).

For reference, here's ktcalc's [announcement reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/rvhme0/kt21_calculator_web_app/)
and
[follow-up thread for fight support](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/s5gczq/kt21_calculator_now_supports_fightingmelee/).

## Future Work

See [issues](https://github.com/jmegner/KT21Calculator/issues), but to comment on the big ones ...
- I would love to do a [mass analysis tab](https://github.com/jmegner/KT21Calculator/issues/13), but it will take a lot of work.
- [FNP for melee](https://github.com/jmegner/KT21Calculator/issues/3) is painful and I don't have any short term or medium term plans to do it.
- Option for user to [select a relevant operative profile](https://github.com/jmegner/KT21Calculator/issues/14) (ex: Necron Immortal with Gauss Blaster) instead of individually selecting parameters.  Low priority because it is high effort and moderate benefit.

## Dev Stuff
Basically, this is a React SPA web app mostly written in TypeScript.
There is some Rust compiled down to wasm for some stuff where I needed more performance.
I use GitHub Actions to test, build, and deploy the web app upon every git-push to main branch.
I do my development in vscode.

List of notable technologies/libs/whatever used...
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the primary programming language.
- [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) for toolchain and package management.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for UI framework.
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for UI components.
- [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (but heavily considering using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/) in future).
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for general JS/TS testing.
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for react-oriented testing.
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for CI/CD.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (vscode) for the IDE.
- For the Deadzone calculator, which is Monte Carlo, I got 10x speed from using wasm.
  - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
  - [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) to build Rust into wasm.
  - [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen)

Dev setup...
- You'll need to install [NodeJS+npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) for building and running.
- Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) to build rust into wasm.
  - Might have to do `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` as well.
- For debugging and otherwise having a nice experience, this project is set up for vscode as the IDE.
- Initially, you'll have to do a `npm ci` to install npm packages with exact versions of previous development.
- Do a `npm run build` to build the wasm and React stuff.
- Do a `npm start` to build the TypeScript stuff and run.
- For debugging non-tests with vscode, be sure to do `npm start` before launching the debugger.
  For debugging tests, you can just launch one of vscode's test-oriented debug profiles.
- To run tests, do `npm test` for normal watch-mode testing that sticks around.
  Do `npm run testq` that does a single run of tests (like doing `test` and then hitting `q` to quit).

My thanks to [Dave/veddermatic](https://github.com/veddermatic) for the nav bar and icons at top.

My thanks to [Kevin/Sigma](https://github.com/DenamPavel) for some initial KT2024 support.

My thanks to Redux maintainer

for his
[advice and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ropftw/comment/hpzxqrf/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
I decided not to use Redux just yet, but look forward to using it.
